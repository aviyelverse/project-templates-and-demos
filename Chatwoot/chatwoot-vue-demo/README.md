# chatwoot-vue-demo

## Project description

This is a demo Vue.js project that integrates the Chatwoot widget within a web page. The template of this demo is based on Jennifer Bland's [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-single-page-application-using-vue-js-vuex-vuetify-and-firebase-838b40721a07/) on building SPA's using Vue.js and Vuetify.

The Chatwoot widget is currently managed on a private account for agent replies and interactions. Please contact [Victor](https://github.com/HeVictor) if you wish to discuss extending the account's functionality.
